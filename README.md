![DALLÂ·E 2024-06-24 11 38 10 - A blog thumbnail image for an article about ts-vo-generator, an open-source software that generates ValueObjects from DomainObjects in TypeScript  The](https://github.com/atomic-kanta-sasaki/typescript-value-object-generator/assets/49396455/62282b82-f084-4329-8ffb-754f901a959f)

`ts-vo-generator` is a tool to generate TypeScript Value Objects from classes. This tool allows you to easily create immutable data structures in TypeScript by generating Value Objects based on constructor arguments.

## Installation

Install `ts-vo-generator` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g ts-vo-generator
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn global add ts-vo-generator
```

## Usage
### Command Line Usage
To use `ts-vo-generator` from the command line, run the following command:
```bash
npx ts-vo-generator <input_file> <output_directory>
```

 - `<input_file>`: Path to the TypeScript file containing the class definitions from which you want to generate Value Objects.
 - `<output_directory>`: Path to the directory where the generated Value Objects will be output.
 - 
If a Value Object already exists in the output directory, the tool will prompt you to either overwrite the existing file or skip the operation.

### Example
Here's an example command to generate Value Objects from `User.ts` and output them to the `ValueObjects` directory:
```bash
npx ts-vo-generator ./src/models/User.ts ./src/ValueObjects
```
